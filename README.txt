File Sorter 

File Sorter is an application to copy and move files between folders. 

Quick search locations are provided that give a file path to common directories like Documents, Downloads, etc.
File paths have to be typed out in full to access the desired location.
	
	e.g. "C:\Users\Windows 10\Documents\File Sorter"

*The program cannot make new directories as of this time. This will have to be done manually.

Files and folders can be displayed in the two large text boxes, with the left being the for the search location and right, the destination location.

Files can also be deleted using this program.
